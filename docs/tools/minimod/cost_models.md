## Cost Model

### Description

Spreadsheet-based models were developed to estimate the costs of alternative micronutrient intervention programs, and combinations of interventions, over a 10-year planning time horizon. Where budgets from existing programs were available, these were used to estimate costs. In some cases, existing budgets were adjusted or adapted to isolate certain interventions or to estimate the costs of similar interventions. When actual budgets were not available, costs were constructed using known unit costs of program components combined with expert knowledge. Total costs for all interventions and combinations of interventions include planning, establishment, operational, and monitoring and evaluation costs.
