What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the context of Cameroon and taken from
Vosti et al. 2022. Data to support the estimation of costs of the establishment, operation, and
monitoring and evaluation of MIPs were drawn from collaborative, activity-based cost analyses
undertaken in Cameroon. More specifically, VAS-CHD is a twice-annual distribution platform with
national (but incomplete) reach, but which can be targeted sub-nationally. Costs of this delivery
platform were estimated based on implementing partners’ detailed accounting documents. In the
model, VAS-Routine is a hypothetical delivery platform via the health system; the estimated national
costs of this delivery platform were based on an implementing partner’s accounting documents
associated with a pilot program in one region of Cameroon. The costs of adding additional fortificants to
existing food fortification programs were based on the estimated costs of the specific fortificants or
compounds included in the premix, plus the factory and public sectors costs associated with quality
assurance and regulation.
More specifically, the figure below provides an overview of the structure of the MINIMOD cost model in
the context of large-scale food fortification programs. Dietary intake data provide estimates of the
amounts of specific delivery vehicles (e.g., wheat flour) consumed. The Premix calculator allows users to
experiment with alternative choices regarding the types and amounts of fortificants to include in a given
premix, including overage amounts (where relevant). Start-up investments and recurring costs faced by
industry and government are included in detail in the cost model.

The degree of compliance of fortification programs to published standards varies across programs, e.g.,
in the specific case of Cameroon, the current wheat flour (zinc and folic acid) and edible oils (VA)
programs perform at 33% and 75% of standards, respectively; these performance indicators were
included to adjust the estimates of program costs and program impacts. To estimate the subnational costs
of national fortification programs, start-up costs were allocated equally across the three macro-
regions (North, South, and Cities) and operational costs were weighted by the proportion of a given food
vehicle that was consumed in a given macro-region. A specific cost model was collaboratively developed
for the hypothetical multi-fortified bouillon cube program. The structure of the model is very similar to
those developed for other existing large-scale food fortification programs (e.g., wheat flour or edible
oils) 18, and key model parameters (including premix fortificant costs) were established during a series
of key informant interviews with collaborators who are very familiar with the food fortification
programs in Cameroon, and elsewhere. The bouillon cube cost model estimates the marginal costs of
adding a specific fortified premix to this condiment, and also considers the time and resources needed
to design, implement, and monitor the program. That is to say, in the model, the expected nutritional
benefits of this new MIP only accrue after the three-year establishment period is completed.
