What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the context of Cameroon and taken from
Vosti et al. 2022. Data to support the estimation of costs of the establishment, operation, and
monitoring and evaluation of MIPs were drawn from collaborative, activity-based cost analyses
undertaken in Cameroon. More specifically, VAS-CHD is a twice-annual distribution platform with
national (but incomplete) reach, but which can be targeted sub-nationally. Costs of this delivery
platform were estimated based on implementing partners’ detailed accounting documents. In the
model, VAS-Routine is a hypothetical delivery platform via the health system; the estimated national
costs of this delivery platform were based on an implementing partner’s accounting documents
associated with a pilot program in one region of Cameroon. The costs of adding additional fortificants to
existing food fortification programs were based on the estimated costs of the specific fortificants or
compounds included in the premix, plus the factory and public sectors costs associated with quality
assurance and regulation.
More specifically, the figure below provides an overview of the structure of the MINIMOD cost model in
the context of large-scale food fortification programs. Dietary intake data provide estimates of the
amounts of specific delivery vehicles (e.g., wheat flour) consumed. The Premix calculator allows users to
experiment with alternative choices regarding the types and amounts of fortificants to include in a given
premix, including overage amounts (where relevant). Start-up investments and recurring costs faced by
industry and government are included in detail in the cost model.
