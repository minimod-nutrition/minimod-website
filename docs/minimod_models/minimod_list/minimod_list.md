What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the context of Cameroon and taken from
Vosti et al. 2022.
The MINIMOD nutrition model was linked with LiST to estimate the number of lives saved based on the
effective coverage of each intervention program via a series of micronutrient-specific pathways in LiST.
Methods used to predict lives saved by VA interventions have been described previously. This method
generates two estimates of the life-saving potential of VA, ‘low’ and ‘high.’ The two estimates reflect
different assumptions about the relative efficacy of achieving dietary adequacy on mortality reduction,
compared to receiving a high-dose VA supplement. A similar method was employed for zinc; however,
we updated the effectiveness values applied in the original LiST model by: 1) adopting low plasma zinc
concentration, rather than low prevalence of inadequate zinc intake in the food supply, as the measure
of the proportion of the population assumed to benefit from zinc interventions, 2) modifying the list of
studies included in the meta-analyses of the effect of zinc supplementation on mortality from diarrhea
and pneumonia, and 3) changing the definition of ‘coverage’ from zinc supplementation with 10 mg/d
(the default in LiST) to receipt of at least 3 mg/d of zinc from any source (i.e., the MAI). For simplicity,
we present estimates only for the ‘high’ life-saving potential of VA and zinc in the main text; the results
for ‘low’ life-saving potential of VA and zinc appear in the Technical Appendix. The reader will note that
the core results of the paper are not sensitive to this presentational choice. The predicted impact of
folic acid fortification on child deaths attributable to neural tube defects was estimated using the
“Expanded LiST method” described by Luo et al. Using these pathways, the MINIMOD estimates of
effective coverage were used to generate estimates of the number of child lives saved for all possible
combinations of MIPs involving VA, zinc, and folic acid included in the model. In LiST, vitamin A and zinc
interventions both affect mortality from diarrhea; therefore, effects of each micronutrient alone on
mortality cannot be simply added to estimate the impact of scaling up both VA and zinc interventions
together 11 . To avoid double-counting, the effects of combinations of interventions involving VA and zinc
were estimated jointly in LiST. In addition, in LiST, the effects of VA intervention programs are applied to children 6-59 months of age, but effects of zinc intervention programs are applied only to children 12-59
months of age. The effect of folic acid on mortality via reductions in neural tube defects (NTD) is
independent of the vitamin A and zinc pathways in LiST, other than very small effects on the number of
children who survive past 6 or 12 months and therefore become eligible for the effects of VA
interventions or zinc interventions, so the effects of folic acid interventions on child mortality were
estimated separately and then added to the estimates of the mortality effects of VA and zinc
interventions.
