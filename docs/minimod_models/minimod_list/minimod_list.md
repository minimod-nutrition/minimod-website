The figure below provides an overview of how the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) ‘translates’ VA effective
coverage into child-lives saved, i.e., how achieving dietary adequacy in VA is linked to changes in child
mortality. The process begins by identifying the number of children who die from causes that are
known to be related to inadequate VA intake, e.g., diarrhea. Then, that number is multiplied by the
percentage of children who ‘graduate’ from inadequate to adequate VA intake (effective coverage).
This is then multiplied by the percent of the child population who could benefit from such an
intervention (those with inadequate VA intake) times the measured effectiveness on mortality of
achieving VA adequacy. The information in the first and final ‘boxes’ in the figure are provided by LiST,
the information in the two intermediate boxes is provided by the MINIMOD nutritional needs/benefits
model.

What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the specific context of Cameroon and taken
from Vosti et al. 2022. The MINIMOD nutrition model was linked with LiST to estimate the number of
lives saved based on the effective coverage of each intervention program via a series of micronutrient-
specific pathways in LiST. Specific methods used to predict lives saved by VA interventions have been
described previously. This method generates two estimates of the life-saving potential of VA, ‘low’ and
‘high.’ The two estimates reflect different assumptions about the relative efficacy of achieving dietary
adequacy on mortality reduction, compared to receiving a high-dose VA supplement. A similar method 
was employed for zinc; however, we updated the effectiveness values applied in the original LiST model
by: 1) adopting low plasma zinc concentration, rather than low prevalence of inadequate zinc intake in
the food supply, as the measure of the proportion of the population assumed to benefit from zinc
interventions, 2) modifying the list of studies included in the meta-analyses of the effect of zinc
supplementation on mortality from diarrhea and pneumonia, and 3) changing the definition of
‘coverage’ from zinc supplementation with 10 mg/d (the default in LiST) to receipt of at least 3 mg/d of
zinc from any source (i.e., the MAI). For simplicity, we present estimates only for the ‘high’ life-saving
potential of VA and zinc in the main text; the results for ‘low’ life-saving potential of VA and zinc appear
in the Technical Appendix. The reader will note that the core results of the paper are not sensitive to this
presentational choice. The predicted impact of folic acid fortification on child deaths attributable to
neural tube defects was estimated using the “Expanded LiST method” described by Luo et al. Using
these pathways, the MINIMOD estimates of effective coverage were used to generate estimates of the
number of child-lives saved for all possible combinations of MIPs involving VA, zinc, and folic acid
included in the model. In LiST, vitamin A and zinc interventions both affect mortality from diarrhea;
therefore, effects of each micronutrient alone on mortality cannot be simply added to estimate the
impact of scaling up both VA and zinc interventions together 11. To avoid double-counting, the effects of
combinations of interventions involving VA and zinc were estimated jointly in LiST. In addition, in LiST,
the effects of VA intervention programs are applied to children 6-59 months of age, but effects of zinc
intervention programs are applied only to children 12-59 months of age. The effect of folic acid on
mortality via reductions in neural tube defects (NTD) is independent of the vitamin A and zinc pathways
in LiST, other than very small effects on the number of children who survive past 6 or 12 months and
therefore become eligible for the effects of VA interventions or zinc interventions, so the effects of folic
acid interventions on child mortality were estimated separately and then added to the estimates of the
mortality effects of VA and zinc interventions.
