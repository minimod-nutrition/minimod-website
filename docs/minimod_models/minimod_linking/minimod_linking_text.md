What follows is an example of how estimates of nutritional benefits/functional outcomes and
intervention program costs can be linked, in the context of Cameroon, and taken from Vosti et al. 2022.

The estimated reach, outcomes (i.e., nutrient adequacy and number of lives saved), costs, and cost-
effectiveness of each micronutrient intervention program (MIP) appear in Table 2. All MIPs are
considered independently in Table 2, and estimates are reported nationally and subnationally for the
entire 10-year planning time horizon for each case. Note that national MIPs, such as large-scale food
fortification programs, can have non-uniform subnational impacts (e.g., due to differences in dietary
intake patterns across macro-regions) and costs. Once again, MIPs are clustered by micronutrient. The
reader will note that zinc-fortified bouillon cubes, at the hypothetical fortification levels, convey very
little zinc to young children and therefore the effective coverage or proportion who meet the threshold
defined for the MAI (3 mg/d) remains low, and consequently no deaths are averted by this MIP.
