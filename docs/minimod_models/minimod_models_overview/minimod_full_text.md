What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the MINIMOD-Full model in the context of
Cameroon and taken from Vosti et al. 2022.
Data to support the estimation of nutritional needs and model benefits were drawn from the 2009
dietary intake survey in Cameroon (n = 902 for WRA and n = 872 for children). The dataset included at
least one day of dietary intake data (collected by 24-hour dietary recall interview) for all respondents,
and a second day of data for a subset of respondents, to enable estimation of the distribution of
habitual dietary intake. The SIMPLE Macro was used to estimate dietary adequacy among young
children and WRA, and the predicted benefits of alternative intervention programs for these targeted
populations, nationally and sub-nationally. The SIMPLE Macro applies the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
method 23 to model the distribution of usual nutrient intakes and to estimate the prevalence of
inadequate intake (i.e., proportion with intakes below the age- and sex-specific estimated average
requirement [EAR]). We first generated baseline scenarios (i.e., dietary intake in the absence of any
MIPs, such as fortification or supplementation), and then simulated the effects of selected MIPs, and
combinations of them, by calculating the additional daily micronutrient intake contributed by one or
more programs and adding this to each person’s baseline intake. We applied the EAR cut-point method
to estimate the prevalence of inadequate intake for each of the target micronutrients. It is important to
note that the impact of multiple MIPs on effective coverage for any given micronutrient are not
additive; that is, the effective coverage of a combination of programs cannot be estimated by simply
adding the effective coverage derived from each individual program. We then reapplied the NCI
method to estimate the post-intervention distribution of usual intakes and prevalence of inadequate
intake under each scenario. To estimate the hypothetical contribution of high-dose VA supplements to
nutrient adequacy, we 1) randomly assigned observations in the data set to be reached by VAS, at
proportions derived from program evaluation data, and 2) for each individual reached, we applied a
“daily equivalent” of 167 µg retinol/d using the recommended “shrink then add” approach. In the
“shrink then add” approach, within-person variation of nutrient intakes from food sources is first
removed to generate a representative sample of modeled habitual intakes from food sources, then the
estimated daily intake of VA from a high-dose VA supplement is added to habitual intakes to produce a
representative sample of usual total nutrient intakes from both food and supplements. Finally, effective
coverage (the percentage of the population that achieves adequate intake attributable to one or more
intervention programs) was calculated as the difference between prevalence of inadequate intake in
each modeled scenario compared with the baseline.
