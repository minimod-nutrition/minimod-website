What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the context of Cameroon and taken from
Vosti et al. 2022.

Details of the economic optimization model used in this study were provided in Vosti et al. 2020. The
model was run on an annual time-step and over a 10-year (Year 2020-Year 2029) planning time horizon.
The model sought to identify the most cost-effective set of micronutrient intervention programs (MIPs)
over time and space (i.e., across the three macro-regions over 10 years), subject to predetermined
policy targets for nutritional outcomes (e.g., effective coverage for VA) or functional outcomes (e.g.,
lives saved), noting that only some MIPs can be subnationally targeted. Again, the model used for this
analysis included three geographic macro-regions – North, South and Cities (Yaoundé and Douala). The
model’s specific objective for this study was to identify the most cost-effective set of MIPs, subject to
doing at least as well as the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario in terms of effective coverage or lives
saved. The BAU scenario was constructed based on the set of programs that were pursued in Cameroon
over the past two decades (VAS distribution nationally via Child Health Days, and national programs to
fortify edible oils with VA and wheat flour with zinc and folic acid; compliance of the latter programs is
modest to good at 33% of target levels for wheat flour and 75% of target levels for oil).
Table 3 reports the results for effective coverage and cost per person effectively covered for individual
and combined MIPs to address dietary inadequacy in the BAU scenario, those chosen by the economic
optimization model, and those that were available but not chosen by the optimization model. The row
labels identify the policy objectives and the target populations explicitly included in the model’s
objective function. More specifically, the rows report effective coverage for young children and WRA for
zinc, VA, and folic acid. In some cases, combinations of MIPs appear in specific cells of Table 3. In these
cases, the nutritional impacts are estimated jointly but neither the nutritional impacts of multiple MIPs
nor the costs of multiple MIPs are additive.
We modeled three MIPs for effectively reaching young children to provide zinc: zinc-fortified wheat
flour (31.4 mg/kg), zinc-fortified wheat flour (95 mg/kg) and zinc-fortified bouillon cubes (600 mg/kg).
The BAU program is zinc-fortified wheat flour (31.4 mg/kg, 33% of standard), effectively covering ~4.6m
children over a 10-year period. The economic optimization algorithm confirms that to be the most cost-
effective choice at $0.44 per child effectively covered; in other words, neither the hypothetical zinc-
fortified bouillon cube program nor the improved zinc-fortified flour program (95 mg/kg) was chosen.
There were five MIPs available in the model for effectively covering children with VA: VA-fortified edible
oils (9 mg/kg), an improved VA-fortified edible oils program (12 mg/kg), national VAS delivered via Child
Health Days (CHD), sub-national VAS also delivered via CHD, VAS delivered via routine health services
(which is assumed to be national in scale, only), and a VA-fortified bouillon cube (80 mg/kg). The BAU MIPs were VA-fortified oils at 9 mg/kg and a national VAS program delivered via CHD. The economic
optimization algorithm retained the VA-fortified oils program at 9 mg/kg, but chose a subnational VAS-
CHD program focusing on the North macro-region, where needs for and the cost-effectiveness of the
VAS-CHD program were greatest, and added the VA-fortified bouillon cube. The higher-performing (but
more expensive) VA-fortified oils and the VAS-Routine programs were not chosen. The collection of BAU
MIPs effectively covers over 14m children over 10 years, at a cost of $2.40 per child effectively covered.
The economically optimal set of MIPs effectively covered slightly more children over 10 years, and did so
more efficiently -- $2.27 per child effectively covered. 
Finally, three MIPs were available in the model to deliver folic acid to WRA: folic acid-fortified wheat
flour (1.65 mg/kg), folic acid-fortified wheat flour (5 mg/kg), and a folic acid-fortified bouillon cube (100
mg/kg). The BAU program was folic acid-fortified wheat flour (1.65 mg/kg). The economic optimization
confirmed that the BAU program was the most cost-effective choice, effectively covering over 17m WRA
over 10 years at a cost of $0.09 per woman effectively covered. The higher-intensity wheat flour
fortification (5 mg of folic acid/kg of flour) and the folic acid-fortified bouillon cube programs were not
chosen.

Notes to Table: BAU, business-as-usual; CHD, Child Health Day; EC, effective coverage; VA, vitamin A; VAS, vitamin A supplementation; WRA, women of reproductive age. Underlined intervention programs represent those that appear in both the BAU and economically optimal scenarios. VAS-CHD and VAS Routine program distribute high-dose vitamin A capsules every 6 months; the contribution to effective coverage is captured with a “daily equivalent” of 167 µg retinol per day. The standard for VA-fortified oil is 12 mg/kg (9 mg/kg = 75% of standard). VA-fortified bouillon cubes contain 80 mg/kg. The folic acid standard for wheat flour fortification is 5 mg/kg (1.65 mg/kg = 33% of standard). The zinc fortification standard for wheat flour is 95 mg/kg (31.4 mg/kg = 33% of standard). Fortified bouillon cubes are assumed to contain 100 mg/kg folic acid and 600 mg/kg zinc. All costs are reported in 2019 USD. National programs, if selected by the optimization algorithm, must be continued each year over the 10-year planning time horizon.  Sub-national programs can be switched on/off in any given macro-region in any given year of the 10-year planning time horizon; to appear in Table 3 and Table 4 as an optimal choice, the program had to appear at least three times in a given macro-region over the planning time horizon.
