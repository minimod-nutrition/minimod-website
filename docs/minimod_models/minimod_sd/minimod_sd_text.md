What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the MINIMOD-SD model in the context of Burkina Faso and taken from Adams et al. forthcoming.
Our metric of effectiveness was effective coverage, defined as the number or percent of a target
population with inadequate micronutrient intake who achieve adequate intake after the introduction of a micronutrient intervention program. While children under 5 years of age are commonly the target population for zinc interventions, LSFF alone is unlikely to meet the zinc requirements of young children because of the relatively small quantities of staple foods consumed, and fortification levels designed not
to exceed the tolerable upper intake level in any population group. Thus, young children in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency are likely to require additional interventions. Given this, we selected pregnant and non-pregnant women age 15-49 years (hereafter women of reproductive age, WRA) as our target population. We modeled the potential effectiveness of adding zinc to Burkina Faso’s
wheat flour fortification standard using household consumption and expenditure survey data collected in 2018/2019 via the Enquête Harmonisée sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages (EHCVM) survey. To capture seasonality in consumption, the EHCVM survey data were collected in two waves (with different
households surveyed in each wave), from October and December of 2018 and from April and July of 2019. In the food consumption and expenditures section of the survey, a household respondent was asked to recall the quantity of each of 138 food items consumed by household members during the seven days preceding the survey.
We used these food consumption data to estimate household daily apparent consumption of each food
item, where apparent emphasizes assumptions inherent in using household-level data, including that all
food was consumed by the household without food waste or loss and was distributed within the
household in proportion to each household member’s age- and sex-specific energy requirements. We
estimated daily apparent food consumption by adjusting the total quantity of food apparently
consumed by the household to reflect the edible portion and yield factor from cooking, where
appropriate, and dividing the resulting quantity by seven days of recall. We identified extreme outliers in reported quantities of food apparently consumed as the food- and region-specific 95 th percentile of
apparent household consumption per adult male equivalent (AME) and replaced outliers above the 95 th
percentile with the value at the 95 th percentile.
To estimate daily apparent household nutrient intake, we then matched each food item to a food
composition table (FCT) entry, or a weighted average of several FCT entries for aggregate or generic
food items, from the West African FCT or, where appropriate matches from the West African FCT were
not available, supplemented with entries from the Nutrition Coordinating Center Nutrient Database for
Standard Reference and the Malawian FCT. Specific matches were based on input from in-country
collaborators. We then estimated the apparent zinc density of the household diet, i.e., daily apparent
zinc intake per 1000 kcal, as the ratio of total daily apparent zinc intake divided by total daily energy
intake, expressed per 1,000 kcal. Estimates of household food consumption based on household survey
data are particularly prone to measurement error given that they are based on the recall of one
household member using a fixed food list and foods consumed away from home are typically
inadequately captured. To help address measurement error, we estimated the energy-adjusted zinc
densities of household diets rather than apparent zinc intakes of WRA. Note that while using energy-
adjusted zinc intake does help account for some measurement errors, it does not address many of the
limitations inherent in using household survey data to estimate micronutrient adequacy, including
potential systematic under/over-reporting of foods with different nutrient contents (e.g., foods
consumed away from home) than foods more accurately captured. We return to this issue in the
discussion section.
We compared the zinc density of the household diet to critical zinc densities for WRA to assess the
adequacy of the household diet for meeting the zinc requirements of WRA. We calculated critical zinc
densities for WRA as their age- and pregnancy-status-specific estimated average requirement (EAR)
divided by their age- and pregnancy-status-specific energy requirements, expressed per 1,000 kcal. To
account for zinc absorption, we estimated absorbable zinc using published algorithms and then adjusted
the absorbed zinc requirements (2.89 mg/d for non-pregnant WRA and 3.59 mg/g for pregnant WRA)
and critical zinc densities based on the estimated percent absorbed zinc in the household samples.
Energy requirements were estimated relative to the FAO/WHO human energy requirement estimate of
2,900 kcal for an 65kg adult male age 18-30 years with moderate physical activity.
The zinc density of the household diet was classified as sufficient to meet the requirements of WRA if it
was above the critical zinc density. Because the pregnancy status of WRA was not collected in the
household survey, we assessed zinc adequacy separately for pregnant and non-pregnant women by (1)
assuming all WRA in the sample were pregnant and assessing zinc adequacy based on the requirements
of pregnant women, (2) assuming all WRA were not pregnant and assessing adequacy based on the
requirements of non-pregnant WRA, and (3) estimating overall zinc adequacy among pregnant and non-
pregnant WRA by combining these estimates as a weighted average, where weights were based on
estimates of the proportion of WRA current pregnant and not pregnant according to the most recent
Demographic and Health Survey data. Because nutrient density is a metric of dietary quality, adequacy
was based on the assumption that WRA were meeting their age- and sex-specific energy requirements.
We modeled the contribution of wheat flour fortified with zinc by multiplying daily apparent household
consumption of wheat flour (including reported consumption of wheat flour and wheat flour equivalents
from products containing wheat flour, such as bread and biscuits) by the average hypothetical zinc
fortification levels under the current program and with improved compliance and recalculating the
nutrient density of the household diet and prevalence of inadequacy. Finally, effective coverage was calculated as the percent of WRA moving from inadequate zinc density from dietary intake without any intervention to increase zinc intakes to adequate zinc density with the introduction of zinc to fortified
wheat flour.
