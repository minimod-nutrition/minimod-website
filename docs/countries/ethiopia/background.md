# Background and Policy Issues

## Background

Largely driven by agroecological differences and cultural practices, Ethiopia is characterized by region-specific dietary composition and diversity. As a result, there is substantial variability in micronutrient deficiencies among target beneficiary groups across Ethiopia’s 11 administrative units (9 regions and 2 major metropolitan areas, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa). Regional differences in infrastructure, human capital, etc., also lead to variability in micronutrient delivery program costs.

## Key Micronutrient Policy Issues

For MINIMOD modeling activities in Ethiopia, key micronutrient policy issues for each of Ethiopia’s 12 regions are:

- For children aged 6-59 months:
    - identification of cost-effective strategies for ensuring adequate dietary intake of vitamin A
    - identification of cost-effective strategies for ensuring adequate dietary intake of zinc
    - identification of cost-effective strategies for ensuring adequate dietary intake of iron
    - assessment of the potential for micronutrient intervention programs to reduce child mortality
    - assessment of the potential for micronutrient intervention programs to reduce child stunting

- For women of reproductive age (15-49 years):
    - identification of cost-effective strategies for addressing deficiencies in dietary intake of iron
    - assessment of the potential for micronutrient intervention programs to reduce maternal anemia
