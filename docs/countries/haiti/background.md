Haiti is a Sub-Saharan African country comprised of three regions. Each of the regions has distinct agro-climactic conditions, dietary intake patterns, and hence prevalences of vitamin and mineral deficiencies among target beneficiary groups, and micronutrient intervention program costs. Expanding and targeting micronutrient intervention programs based on spatial variations in need, benefits, and costs can generate efficiency gains, i.e., achieving greater success in addressing micronutrient deficiencies for the same level of funding, or, reducing the costs of achieving the success generated by current sets of micronutrient intervention programs.
