Both the MINIMOD-Full and the MINIMOD-SD tools have been developed to estimate the intake and apparent intake of micronutrients, and the % of population subgroups that have inadequate micronutrient intake, and to assess the contributions (individually and in combinations) of existing and alternative hypothetical large-scale food fortification program (LSFF) to reducing inadequate apparent intake.  MINIMOD cost models have been developed for all of the existing and hypothetical LSFF programs.
