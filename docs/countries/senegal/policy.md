A MINIMOD-Senegal in-country team has been established in order to: a) identify the nutrition policy landscape, b) identify the micronutrient policy issues being discussed, c) develop the MINIMOD-SD tool and its underlying data, and d) distill and deliver policy results that emerge from the tool to decisionmakers in timely and useful ways. The MINIMOD team has been an integral part of the national Bouillon Country Working Group (CWG), contributing to the evidence base that the CWG is using to develop national policies and standards for the multi-fortification of bouillon.
