Based on the work of the MINIMOD team and collaborators to date, the following key messages summarize the project’s recommendations for countries aiming to identify more cost-effective sets of micronutrient intervention programs:

??? minimod "Know your problems"
    - Know your diets, nationally and sub-nationally
    - Know your micronutrient deficiencies, nationally and sub-nationally

??? minimod "Define your intervention program objectives clearly and concretely"
    - Select one or more specific targets – e.g., reach, coverage, effective coverage, lives saved, cases of anemia avoided
    - Identify target beneficiary groups, e.g., young children, or women of reproductive age
    - Define your program impact pathways

??? minimod "Know your existing programs"
    - What intervention programs are currently being implemented (where, by whom)
    - What are the nutritional impacts of each intervention (is it at full potential, what target groups are benefiting, and how much)

??? minimod "Know the expected benefits of alternative programs"
    - Know the potential contributions of alternative programs to reducing inadequate intake of micronutrients for the different target beneficiary groups

??? minimod "Know the costs of existing and alternative programs"
    - Include all costs; formative research, establishment and operational costs, M&E costs
    - Address the costs of intervention programs from the outset
    - Include all relevant stakeholder groups in discussion of program costs

??? minimod "Aim for efficient solutions"
    - Let cost-effectiveness be your guide in selecting combinations of intervention programs

??? minimod "Adopt a multi-year, sub-national framework"
    - Select cost-effective combinations of national and sub-national intervention programs, and practical multi-year pathways for implementing them

??? minimod "Monitor your programs"
    - Include all program phases: planning, implementation, outputs, outcomes
    - Establish and fund formal multi-sectoral monitoring and coordination teams to ensure results
  
??? minimod "Keep an eye on the most vulnerable"
    - The poor merit special attention and may warrant special nutrition intervention programs
