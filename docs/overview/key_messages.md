Based on the work of the MINIMOD team and collaborators to date, the following key messages summarize the project’s recommendations for countries aiming to identify more cost-effective sets of micronutrient intervention programs:

??? minimod "Know your problems"
    - Know your diets, sub-nationally
    - Know your micronutrient deficiencies, sub-nationally

??? minimod "Define your objectives clearly and concretely"
    - Select one or more specific targets – e.g., reach, coverage, effective coverage, lives saved, cases of anemia avoided
    - Identify key beneficiary groups, e.g., young children, or women of reproductive age
    - Define your program impact pathways

??? minimod "Know your existing programs"
    - What interventions are currently being implemented (where, by whom)
    - What are the impacts of each intervention (is it at full potential, what target groups are benefiting, and how much)

??? minimod "Know the expected benefits of alternative programs"
    Know the contributions of alternative programs to reducing micronutrient deficiencies for the different target groups

??? minimod "Know the costs of existing and alternative programs"
    Formative research, establishment and operational costs, M & E costs

??? minimod "Aim for efficient solutions"
    Let cost-effectiveness be your guide in selecting combinations of interventions

??? minimod "Adopt a multi-year, sub-national framework"
    Select cost-effective combinations of national and sub-national programs, and practical multi-year pathways for implementing them

??? minimod "Monitor your programs"
    - Planning, implementation, outputs, outcomes
    - Establish and fund formal multi-sectoral monitoring and coordination teams to ensure results
  
??? minimod "Keep an eye on the most vulnerable"
    The poor merit special attention and may warrant special nutrition programs
