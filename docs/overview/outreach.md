## Collaboration
The MINIMOD team collaborates closely with in-country counterparts in the development of all models.  Collaborations begin with the identification of the key micronutrient policy issues to be addressed and the policy-making bodies to be engaged, then proceeds to the data collection/cleaning, then on to model development and testing, and finally to model use to enhance the evidence base available to support micronutrient policy discussions.

## Training
The MINIMOD team trains collaborators formally and informally in model development and use, and in policy engagement.  Formal training includes collaborators spending extended amounts of time on the UC Davis campus working closely with faculty and project scientists in the Department of Nutrition and in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics.  Informal training includes in-country and virtual activities throughout the model development and use processes.

## Policy Engagement
Policy engagement begins at the outset of every project, and culminates in the delivery of new evidence bases to policy-making bodies and key individuals within them.  A first step in policy engagement is the preparation of detailed nutrition policy landscapes, which facilitate the identification of policy-making bodies, or organizations that influence them, for targeted policy engagement activities.
