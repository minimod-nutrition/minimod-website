The MINIMOD tool can help identify practical transition options for micronutrient intervention programs.8 (Cite the 2019 NYAS paper by Vosti et al., here) The figure below charts a path in the case of the Southern macro-region in Cameroon from a current set of programs (VAS via Child Health Days and a low-level VA-fortified edible oils program) to one that includes a VA-fortified bouillon cube (which takes several years to develop and promote) and an improved VA-fortified edible oils program (which takes two years to achieve).  Note that, in this macro-region, once these two programs are in place, inadequate intake of VA ceases to be a public health problem and the number of VA-preventable deaths shrinks to practically zero.  The programmatic savings (which can be repurposed to address other nutrition problems) can be substantial, and will depend on the number and timing of field-based confirmation exercises that are required. </p> <p></p> <p>That said, it is not always the case that cost-effective nutrition policy changes can bring about reductions in spending on current programs. The figure below depicts the same investment scenario noted above, but this time in the North macro-region of Cameroon, where inadequate intake of VA is much more prevalent and severe. In this setting, the two new programs do reduce the prevalence of inadequate VA intake among children, but not to a level that permits the elimination of VAS distribution via Child Health Days. </p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Regan L Bailey, Keith P West Jr, and Robert E Black.

These models, including supporting data and outputs, are depicted in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <p>The nutritional needs/benefits model (upper left of the figure above), uses data on usual or apparent dietary intakes to provide spatially explicit estimates of the numbers of individuals with inadequate micronutrient intake, and the predicted effects of existing or alternative (hypothetical) intervention programs, or combinations of them, on the numbers of individuals with inadequate intake, or related outcomes such as child deaths averted. Estimated nutritional needs and intervention program benefits are spatially and temporally explicit, i.e., results can be generated at the national and subnational levels, at an annual timestep. The intervention program cost model provides estimates of the total economic costs of designing, planning, launching, and managing micronutrient intervention programs; cost estimates are also spatially and temporally explicit, and \u2018match\u2019 those of the nutritional needs/benefit model.  Results of the nutritional needs/benefits and cost models can be merged to provide evidence of the cost-effectiveness of alternative programs.
