Data to support the estimation of costs of the establishment, operation, and monitoring and evaluation of MIPs were drawn from collaborative, activity-based cost analyses undertaken in Cameroon. More specifically, VAS-CHD is a twice-annual distribution platform with national (but incomplete) reach, but which can be targeted sub-nationally. Costs of this delivery platform were estimated based on implementing partners\u2019 detailed accounting documents. In the model, VAS-Routine is a hypothetical delivery platform via the health system; the estimated national costs of this delivery platform were based on an implementing partner\u2019s accounting documents associated with a pilot program in one region of Cameroon. The costs of adding additional fortificants to existing food fortification programs were based on the estimated costs of the specific fortificants or compounds included in the premix, plus the factory and public sectors costs associated with quality assurance and regulation. The degree of compliance of fortification programs to published standards varies across programs, i.e., , the current wheat flour (zinc and folic acid) and edible oils (VA) programs perform at 33% and 75% of standards, respectively; these performance indicators were included to adjust the estimates of program costs and program impacts. To estimate the subnational costs of national fortification programs, start-up costs were allocated equally across the three macro-regions (North, South, and Cities) and operational costs were weighted by the proportion of a given food vehicle that was consumed in a given macro-region. A specific cost model was collaboratively developed for the hypothetical multi-fortified bouillon cube program. The structure of the model is very similar to those developed for other existing large-scale food fortification programs (e.g., wheat flour or edible oils) 18 , and key model parameters (including premix fortificant costs) were established during a series of key informant interviews with collaborators who are very familiar with the food fortification programs in Cameroon, and elsewhere. The bouillon cube cost model estimates the marginal costs of adding a specific fortified premix to this condiment, and also considers the time and resources needed to design, implement, and monitor the program.

The MINIMOD nutrition model was linked with LiST to estimate the number of lives saved based on the effective coverage of each intervention program via a series of micronutrient-specific pathways in LiST. Methods used to predict lives saved by VA interventions have been described previously. This method generates two estimates of the life-saving potential of VA, \u2018low\u2019 and \u2018high.\u2019 The two estimates reflect different assumptions about the relative efficacy of achieving dietary adequacy on mortality reduction, compared to receiving a high-dose VA supplement. A similar method was employed for zinc; however, we updated the effectiveness values applied in the original LiST model by: 1) adopting low plasma zinc concentration, rather than low prevalence of inadequate zinc intake in the food supply, as the measure of the proportion of the population assumed to benefit from zinc interventions, 2) modifying the list of studies included in the meta-analyses of the effect of zinc supplementation on mortality from diarrhea and pneumonia, and 3) changing the definition of \u2018coverage\u2019 from zinc supplementation with 10 mg/d (the default in LiST) to receipt of at least 3 mg/d of zinc from any source (i.e., the MAI). For simplicity, we present estimates only for the \u2018high\u2019 life-saving potential of VA and zinc in the main text; the results for \u2018low\u2019 life-saving potential of VA and zinc appear in the Technical Appendix. The reader will note that the core results of the paper are not sensitive to this presentational choice. The predicted impact of folic acid fortification on child deaths attributable to neural tube defects was estimated using the \u201cExpanded LiST method\u201d described by Luo et al. Using these pathways, the MINIMOD estimates of effective coverage were used to generate estimates of the number of child lives saved for all possible combinations of MIPs involving VA, zinc, and folic acid included in the model. In LiST, vitamin A and zinc interventions both affect mortality from diarrhea; therefore, effects of each micronutrient alone on mortality cannot be simply added to estimate the impact of scaling up both VA and zinc interventions together 11 . To avoid double-counting, the effects of combinations of interventions involving VA and zinc were estimated jointly in LiST. In addition, in LiST, the effects of VA intervention programs are applied to children 6-59 months of age, but effects of zinc intervention programs are applied only to children 12-59 months of age. The effect of folic acid on mortality via reductions in neural tube defects (NTD) is independent of the vitamin A and zinc pathways in LiST, other than very small effects on the number of children who survive past 6 or 12 months and therefore become eligible for the effects of VA interventions or zinc interventions, so the effects of folic acid interventions on child mortality were estimated separately and then added to the estimates of the mortality effects of VA and zinc interventions.</p>"},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_models_overview/minimod_full_text/","title":"Minimod full text","text":"<p>What follows is an example of the data and methods used in the MINIMOD-Full model in the context of Cameroon and taken from Vosti et al. 2022. Data to support the estimation of nutritional needs and model benefits were drawn from the 2009 dietary intake survey in Cameroon (n = 902 for WRA and n = 872 for children). The dataset included at least one day of dietary intake data (collected by 24-hour dietary recall interview) for all respondents, and a second day of data for a subset of respondents, to enable estimation of the distribution of habitual dietary intake. The SIMPLE Macro was used to estimate dietary adequacy among young children and WRA, and the predicted benefits of alternative intervention programs for these targeted populations, nationally and sub-nationally. The SIMPLE Macro applies the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method 23 to model the distribution of usual nutrient intakes and to estimate the prevalence of inadequate intake (i.e., proportion with intakes below the age- and sex-specific estimated average requirement [EAR]). We first generated baseline scenarios (i.e., dietary intake in the absence of any MIPs, such as fortification or supplementation), and then simulated the effects of selected MIPs, and combinations of them, by calculating the additional daily micronutrient intake contributed by one or more programs and adding this to each person\u2019s baseline intake. We applied the EAR cut-point method to estimate the prevalence of inadequate intake for each of the target micronutrients. It is important to note that the impact of multiple MIPs on effective coverage for any given micronutrient are not additive; that is, the effective coverage of a combination of programs cannot be estimated by simply adding the effective coverage derived from each individual program. We then reapplied the NCI method to estimate the post-intervention distribution of usual intakes and prevalence of inadequate intake under each scenario. To estimate the hypothetical contribution of high-dose VA supplements to nutrient adequacy, we 1) randomly assigned observations in the data set to be reached by VAS, at proportions derived from program evaluation data, and 2) for each individual reached, we applied a \u201cdaily equivalent\u201d of 167 \u00b5g retinol/d using the recommended \u201cshrink then add\u201d approach. In the \u201cshrink then add\u201d approach, within-person variation of nutrient intakes from food sources is first removed to generate a representative sample of modeled habitual intakes from food sources, then the estimated daily intake of VA from a high-dose VA supplement is added to habitual intakes to produce a representative sample of usual total nutrient intakes from both food and supplements. Finally, effective coverage (the percentage of the population that achieves adequate intake attributable to one or more intervention programs) was calculated as the difference between prevalence of inadequate intake in each modeled scenario compared with the baseline.</p>"},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_models_overview/models_overview_text/","title":"MINIMOD Models - An Overview","text":""},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_models_overview/models_overview_text/#under-construction","title":"Under Construction!","text":""},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_nutritional/minimod_full_tool/benefits_models/","title":"Benefits models","text":""},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_nutritional/minimod_full_tool/benefits_models/#benefits-model","title":"Benefits Model","text":""},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_nutritional/minimod_full_tool/benefits_models/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>The MINIMOD team has developed a set of modeling methods (the \u201cnutrition benefits models\u201d) to predict the impact of alternative micronutrient intervention programs, and combinations of programs.

The model was run on an annual time-step and over a 10-year (Year 2020-Year 2029) planning time horizon. The model sought to identify the most cost-effective set of micronutrient intervention programs (MIPs) over time and space (i.e., across the three macro-regions over 10 years), subject to predetermined policy targets for nutritional outcomes (e.g., effective coverage for VA) or functional outcomes (e.g., lives saved), noting that only some MIPs can be subnationally targeted. Again, the model used for this analysis included three geographic macro-regions \u2013 North, South and Cities (Yaound\u00e9 and Douala). The model\u2019s specific objective for this study was to identify the most cost-effective set of MIPs, subject to doing at least as well as the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario in terms of effective coverage or lives saved. The BAU scenario was constructed based on the set of programs that were pursued in Cameroon over the past two decades (VAS distribution nationally via Child Health Days, and national programs to fortify edible oils with VA and wheat flour with zinc and folic acid; compliance of the latter programs is modest to good at 33% of target levels for wheat flour and 75% of target levels for oil). Table 3 reports the results for effective coverage and cost per person effectively covered for individual and combined MIPs to address dietary inadequacy in the BAU scenario, those chosen by the economic optimization model, and those that were available but not chosen by the optimization model. The row labels identify the policy objectives and the target populations explicitly included in the model\u2019s objective function. More specifically, the rows report effective coverage for young children and WRA for zinc, VA, and folic acid. In some cases, combinations of MIPs appear in specific cells of Table 3. In these cases, the nutritional impacts are estimated jointly but neither the nutritional impacts of multiple MIPs nor the costs of multiple MIPs are additive. We modeled three MIPs for effectively reaching young children to provide zinc: zinc-fortified wheat flour (31.4 mg/kg), zinc-fortified wheat flour (95 mg/kg) and zinc-fortified bouillon cubes (600 mg/kg). The BAU program is zinc-fortified wheat flour (31.4 mg/kg, 33% of standard), effectively covering ~4.6m children over a 10-year period. The economic optimization algorithm confirms that to be the most cost- effective choice at $0.44 per child effectively covered; in other words, neither the hypothetical zinc- fortified bouillon cube program nor the improved zinc-fortified flour program (95 mg/kg) was chosen. There were five MIPs available in the model for effectively covering children with VA: VA-fortified edible oils (9 mg/kg), an improved VA-fortified edible oils program (12 mg/kg), national VAS delivered via Child Health Days (CHD), sub-national VAS also delivered via CHD, VAS delivered via routine health services (which is assumed to be national in scale, only), and a VA-fortified bouillon cube (80 mg/kg). The BAU MIPs were VA-fortified oils at 9 mg/kg and a national VAS program delivered via CHD. The economic optimization algorithm retained the VA-fortified oils program at 9 mg/kg, but chose a subnational VAS- CHD program focusing on the North macro-region, where needs for and the cost-effectiveness of the VAS-CHD program were greatest, and added the VA-fortified bouillon cube. The higher-performing (but more expensive) VA-fortified oils and the VAS-Routine programs were not chosen. The collection of BAU MIPs effectively covers over 14m children over 10 years, at a cost of $2.40 per child effectively covered. The economically optimal set of MIPs effectively covered slightly more children over 10 years, and did so more efficiently -- $2.27 per child effectively covered.  Finally, three MIPs were available in the model to deliver folic acid to WRA: folic acid-fortified wheat flour (1.65 mg/kg), folic acid-fortified wheat flour (5 mg/kg), and a folic acid-fortified bouillon cube (100 mg/kg). The BAU program was folic acid-fortified wheat flour (1.65 mg/kg). The economic optimization confirmed that the BAU program was the most cost-effective choice, effectively covering over 17m WRA over 10 years at a cost of $0.09 per woman effectively covered.

Our metric of effectiveness was effective coverage, defined as the number or percent of a target population with inadequate micronutrient intake who achieve adequate intake after the introduction of a micronutrient intervention program. While children under 5 years of age are commonly the target population for zinc interventions, LSFF alone is unlikely to meet the zinc requirements of young children because of the relatively small quantities of staple foods consumed, and fortification levels designed not to exceed the tolerable upper intake level in any population group. Thus, young children in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency are likely to require additional interventions. Given this, we selected pregnant and non-pregnant women age 15-49 years (hereafter women of reproductive age, WRA) as our target population. We modeled the potential effectiveness of adding zinc to Burkina Faso\u2019s wheat flour fortification standard using household consumption and expenditure survey data collected in 2018/2019 via the Enqu\u00eate Harmonis\u00e9e sur les Conditions de Vie des M\u00e9nages (EHCVM) survey. To capture seasonality in consumption, the EHCVM survey data were collected in two waves (with different households surveyed in each wave), from October and December of 2018 and from April and July of 2019. In the food consumption and expenditures section of the survey, a household respondent was asked to recall the quantity of each of 138 food items consumed by household members during the seven days preceding the survey. We used these food consumption data to estimate household daily apparent consumption of each food item, where apparent emphasizes assumptions inherent in using household-level data, including that all food was consumed by the household without food waste or loss and was distributed within the household in proportion to each household member\u2019s age- and sex-specific energy requirements. We estimated daily apparent food consumption by adjusting the total quantity of food apparently consumed by the household to reflect the edible portion and yield factor from cooking, where appropriate, and dividing the resulting quantity by seven days of recall. We identified extreme outliers in reported quantities of food apparently consumed as the food- and region-specific 95 th percentile of apparent household consumption per adult male equivalent (AME) and replaced outliers above the 95 th percentile with the value at the 95 th percentile. To estimate daily apparent household nutrient intake, we then matched each food item to a food composition table (FCT) entry, or a weighted average of several FCT entries for aggregate or generic food items, from the West African FCT or, where appropriate matches from the West African FCT were not available, supplemented with entries from the Nutrition Coordinating Center Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and the Malawian FCT. Specific matches were based on input from in-country collaborators. We then estimated the apparent zinc density of the household diet, i.e., daily apparent zinc intake per 1000 kcal, as the ratio of total daily apparent zinc intake divided by total daily energy intake, expressed per 1,000 kcal. Estimates of household food consumption based on household survey data are particularly prone to measurement error given that they are based on the recall of one household member using a fixed food list and foods consumed away from home are typically inadequately captured. To help address measurement error, we estimated the energy-adjusted zinc densities of household diets rather than apparent zinc intakes of WRA. Note that while using energy- adjusted zinc intake does help account for some measurement errors, it does not address many of the limitations inherent in using household survey data to estimate micronutrient adequacy, including potential systematic under/over-reporting of foods with different nutrient contents (e.g., foods consumed away from home) than foods more accurately captured. We return to this issue in the discussion section. We compared the zinc density of the household diet to critical zinc densities for WRA to assess the adequacy of the household diet for meeting the zinc requirements of WRA. We calculated critical zinc densities for WRA as their age- and pregnancy-status-specific estimated average requirement (EAR) divided by their age- and pregnancy-status-specific energy requirements, expressed per 1,000 kcal. To account for zinc absorption, we estimated absorbable zinc using published algorithms and then adjusted the absorbed zinc requirements (2.89 mg/d for non-pregnant WRA and 3.59 mg/g for pregnant WRA) and critical zinc densities based on the estimated percent absorbed zinc in the household samples. Energy requirements were estimated relative to the FAO/WHO human energy requirement estimate of 2,900 kcal for an 65kg adult male age 18-30 years with moderate physical activity. The zinc density of the household diet was classified as sufficient to meet the requirements of WRA if it was above the critical zinc density. Because the pregnancy status of WRA was not collected in the household survey, we assessed zinc adequacy separately for pregnant and non-pregnant women by (1) assuming all WRA in the sample were pregnant and assessing zinc adequacy based on the requirements of pregnant women, (2) assuming all WRA were not pregnant and assessing adequacy based on the requirements of non-pregnant WRA, and (3) estimating overall zinc adequacy among pregnant and non- pregnant WRA by combining these estimates as a weighted average, where weights were based on estimates of the proportion of WRA current pregnant and not pregnant according to the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data. Because nutrient density is a metric of dietary quality, adequacy was based on the assumption that WRA were meeting their age- and sex-specific energy requirements. We modeled the contribution of wheat flour fortified with zinc by multiplying daily apparent household consumption of wheat flour (including reported consumption of wheat flour and wheat flour equivalents from products containing wheat flour, such as bread and biscuits) by the average hypothetical zinc fortification levels under the current program and with improved compliance and recalculating the nutrient density of the household diet and prevalence of inadequacy. Finally, effective coverage was calculated as the percent of WRA moving from inadequate zinc density from dietary intake without any intervention to increase zinc intakes to adequate zinc density with the introduction of zinc to fortified wheat flour.</p>"},{"location":"minimod_models/minimod_sd/overview/","title":"Coming soon!","text":""},{"location":"overview/key_messages/","title":"Key Messages","text":"<p>Based on the work of the MINIMOD team and collaborators to date, the following key messages summarize the project\u2019s recommendations for countries aiming to identify more cost-effective sets of micronutrient intervention programs:</p> Know your problems <ul> <li>Know your diets, nationally and sub-nationally</li> <li>Know your micronutrient deficiencies, nationally and sub-nationally</li> </ul> Define your intervention program objectives clearly and concretely <ul> <li>Select one or more specific targets \u2013 e.g., reach, coverage, effective coverage, lives saved, cases of anemia avoided</li> <li>Identify target beneficiary groups, e.g., young children, or women of reproductive age</li> <li>Define your program impact pathways</li> </ul> Know your existing programs <ul> <li>What intervention programs are currently being implemented (where, by whom)</li> <li>What are the nutritional impacts of each intervention (is it at full potential, what target groups are benefiting, and how much)</li> </ul> Know the expected benefits of alternative programs <ul> <li>Know the potential contributions of alternative programs to reducing inadequate intake of micronutrients for the different target beneficiary groups</li> </ul> Know the costs of existing and alternative programs <ul> <li>Include all costs; formative research, establishment and operational costs, M&amp;E costs</li> <li>Address the costs of intervention programs from the outset</li> <li>Include all relevant stakeholder groups in discussion of program costs</li> </ul> Aim for efficient solutions <ul> <li>Let cost-effectiveness be your guide in selecting combinations of intervention programs</li> </ul> Adopt a multi-year, sub-national framework <ul> <li>Select cost-effective combinations of national and sub-national intervention programs, and practical multi-year pathways for implementing them</li> </ul> Monitor your programs <ul> <li>Include all program phases: planning, implementation, outputs, outcomes</li> <li>Establish and fund formal multi-sectoral monitoring and coordination teams to ensure results</li> </ul> Keep an eye on the most vulnerable <ul> <li>The poor merit special attention and may warrant special nutrition intervention programs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/policy_issues/","title":"Micronutrient Policy Issues - An Example from Cameroon","text":""},{"location":"overview/policy_issues/#micronutrient-deficiencies-in-developing-countries","title":"Micronutrient Deficiencies in Developing Countries","text":"<p>Micronutrients are key to promoting and sustaining life and development, and the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries is widespread. 1 Prevalence rates for some micronutrients can vary spatially, suggesting that in some cases, subnational intervention programs may be the most effective, and cost-effective.
