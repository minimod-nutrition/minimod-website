Context Micronutrient deficiencies are major contributors to morbidity and mortality among children and women globally. Major intervention strategies for addressing micronutrient deficiencies include: 1) micronutrient supplementation; 2) large- scale food fortification; 3) social and behavior change communications to promote dietary changes and/or breastfeeding; and 4) agricultural interventions, including agro- and biofortification, to increase the supplies of foods rich in micronutrients such as vitamin A, zinc, and iron. However, little guidance is available on how to select the most appropriate intervention strategy, or mix of strategies, to reach the greatest number of individuals at risk of deficiency and at lowest cost in a given context. Likewise, information is lacking on how best to plan and manage sub-national strategies to help meet the micronutrient needs of women and children to the extent possible when program funds, time, or trained personnel are limited. Objectives Use nationally representative dietary intake and biomarker data to identify the spatial distributions of selected micronutrient deficiencies within the population and the sub-groups at greatest risk Develop a model to predict the effects of alternative micronutrient intervention programs, and combinations of them, on adequacy of dietary intake of key micronutrients (the \u201cnutrition benefits model\u201d) Develop a model to predict the costs of alternative micronutrient intervention programs, and combinations of them, over a 10-year planning time horizon (the \u201ccost model\u201d) Develop an economic optimization model that can identify the most cost-effective strategies for addressing micronutrient deficiencies, subject to funding and other constraints, over a 10-year planning time horizon Use the economic optimization model to identify national and sub-national policy strategies for transitioning from current micronutrient intervention programs to more cost-effective sets of programs Use these data and tools, and the results of model simulations, to inform policy discussions around micronutrient deficiencies Focus Micronutrients to Date Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Folate, Iron, Zinc, and Iodine Target Beneficiary Groups Children aged 6-59 months; women of reproductive age Measures of Program Impacts Reach, coverage, effective coverage, supplemental intake, lives saved and anemia cases avoided (in collaboration with the LiST model), excessive intake Expected Outcomes Evidence-based suggestions for more effective and cost-effective national and sub-national micronutrient intervention programs over the 10-year planning time horizons Country Projects Cameroon and Ethiopia Tools Under Development Full MINIMOD tool making use of individual dietary intake and other primary data, and \"simplified\" MINIMOD tool making use of other available (secondary) data Project Partners Helen Keller International-Cameroon, Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The map below depicts vitamin A deficiencies among young children in Cameroon, by region. Several micronutrients have been identified by the international community as especially critical, in part because of their effects on the growth and development of young children. For example, the World Health Assembly has set a 50% reduction, by 2025, in anemia among women of reproductive age as one of its Global Nutrition Targets . A second target is a 40% reduction in the number of children under 5 years of age who are stunted \u2013 addressing micronutrient deficiencies may have an important role to play in achieving this target in some populations. Consequence of Unmet Needs The effects of micronutrient deficiencies can be substantial, long-lasting, and have large economic consequences. 2 3 For example, reducing iron deficiencies in Haiti by fortifying wheat flour over a 12-year period is estimated to have a cost-benefit ratio of approximately 24 4 , suggesting the returns to investing in wheat flour fortification far outweigh the costs. Policy Objectives Associated with Needs Once an agreed-upon set of micronutrient deficiencies has been established for policy action, the next critical step is to identify the measure, or measures, of impact that will be monitored and used to assess the success of selected intervention programs. Candidate measures of success include: 5 Reach: the number (or %) of the target population (deficient or not) that consume more of a given micronutrient. Coverage: the number (or %) of the target population that is deficient and that consume more of a given micronutrient. Effective coverage: the number (or %) of the target population that is deficient and that consume a sufficient additional amount of a given micronutrient to reach sufficient status. Minimum adequate intake: the number (or %) of the target population (deficient or not) that consume at least a specific additional amount of a given micronutrient (regardless of whether or not sufficient status is achieved). Lives saved: the number (or %) of the target population whose lives are saved due to increased consumption of a given micronutrient. 6 Policy Instruments for Meeting Needs There are many, often competing, ways of addressing micronutrient deficiencies; the expected impacts (however measured) and costs of these alternative intervention programs generally vary over space and time. Some examples of intervention programs include: Large-scale fortification of staple foods and condiments Biofortification of staple crops Distribution of high-dose vitamin A capsules to young children Social and behavior change communication to promote breastfeeding Promotion of the production and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods The Costs of Micronutrient Intervention Programs Nothing is free. All micronutrient intervention programs require upfront investments during the establishment phase, and funds to cover operational cost and monitoring and evaluation expenses. As with intervention program benefits, program costs can also vary over space and time. For example, regarding spatial variation, the map at right reports the region-specific costs of two Child Health Day campaigns in Cameroon, during which high-dose vitamin A capsules (and other products and services) were distributed.[@kagin2015measuring] MINIMOD Approach to Choosing Cost-effective Sets of Micronutrient Intervention Programs Finally, once decision-makers know the expected benefits and costs of all alternative combinations of national and sub-national micronutrient intervention programs, they must choose which ones to implement. However, choosing among potentially many hundreds of combinations of national and subnational program options can be very challenging, especially if some candidate interventions generate non-uniform benefits, or face non-uniform costs over space and time. The MINIMOD project solves this problem by developing an economic optimization model that \u2018searches\u2019 over all possible combinations of candidate interventions and, using cost-effectiveness as its decision criterion, chooses the most cost-effective set of programs for achieving an agreed-upon objective. The cost savings associated with selecting more cost-effective intervention packages can be substantial. 7 Regan L Bailey, Keith P West Jr, and Robert E Black.

Using mixed-integer linear programming, this information is combined to find economically efficient micronutrient intervention programs. The model can identify the intervention, or set of interventions, that most cost-effectively meet specific micronutrient objectives, e.g., effectively covering the same number of children as the set of micronutrient intervention programs current in place. The model can also be used to identify the maximum achievable impact (e.g., greatest number of child lives saved) given funding or other constraints. Theoretically, the usefulness of the economic optimization model inherently depends on variation over space, time, and across target beneficiary groups in expected costs and benefits associated with alternative interventions. Even in a spatially homogenous country, predicting the benefits and costs of alternative program or policy scenarios can generate new insights that are useful for the planning process. Practically, the optimization model\u2019s usefulness depends on the extent to which policy-makers use the information generated by the model process and can develop and implement programs that vary over space, time, and across target beneficiary groups, in ways suggested by the model. Pathways Analysis Two other great concerns of decision-makers in Cameroon are: 1) the speed with which policy changes can practically be implemented; and 2) the evidence base that is required before \u2018turning off\u2019 major programs, especially those known to protect children at risk of micronutrient-related mortality. To address this issue in the context of vitamin A deficiency in young children, we used the economic optimization tool to construct alternative policy pathways leading from business-as-usual to more cost-effective sets of policies for addressing vitamin A deficiency. The results suggest, as expected, that the prudent policy pathways are macro-region-specific. These and other policy pathway analyses have greatly enhance the uptake of core MINIMOD messages in Cameroon and internationally and greatly enriched policy discussions in both arenas.","title":"Cameroon Models"},{"location":"tools/models/#cameroon-models","text":"As summarized in the figure above, to provide input into the planning and more efficient management of micronutrient intervention programs in Cameroon, the MINIMOD team has developed three sets of models.
